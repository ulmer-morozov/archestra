 * For example {"com.company/zone": "Z1", "com.company/rack": "R3"}
 * Valid keys have two segments: an OPTIONAL prefix and name, separated

 * The key name segment is REQUIRED. The prefix is OPTIONAL.
 * The key name MUST be 63 characters or less, begin and end with an
 * alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]), and contain only dashes (-),
 * underscores (_), dots (.), or alphanumerics in between, for example
 * "zone".

 * lower-case alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9]), contain only
 * dashes (-), dots (.), or lower-case alphanumerics in between, and
 * follow domain name notation format
 * (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1).
 * The key prefix SHOULD include the plugin's host company name and/or
 * the plugin name, to minimize the possibility of collisions with keys
 * from other plugins.
 * If a key prefix is specified, it MUST be identical across all
 * topology keys returned by the SP (across all RPCs).
 * Keys MUST be case-insensitive. Meaning the keys "Zone" and "zone"
 * MUST not both exist.
 * Each value (topological segment) MUST contain 1 or more strings.
 * Each string MUST be 63 characters or less and begin and end with an

   *
   * Example 3:
